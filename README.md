# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **GitHub repository**, where I have uploaded three Machine Learning projects using **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for different classification tasks. Each project is structured with proper data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---
## **1. Rock vs. Mine Classification (Sonar Dataset)**
In this project, I used **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a given signal is from a **rock** or a **mine** based on the **Sonar dataset**.

### **Key Steps:**
- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature selection and transformation.
- Training and evaluating a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Identify objects as either **rock** or **mine** using **sonar signals**.

## **2. Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression**
This project applies **Logistic Regression** to detect whether a news article is **fake** or **real**. I used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to process the textual data and convert it into a numerical format for model training.

### **Key Steps:**
- Used **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text preprocessing.
- Removed unwanted words using **NLTK stopwords**.
- Converted text into numerical representation using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model for classification.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Build a model that can accurately classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content.

## **3. Loan Status Prediction using SVM**
This project predicts the **loan approval status** of an applicant based on multiple features such as **education, marital status, gender, loan amount, etc.** using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

### **Key Steps:**
- Handled categorical data by using the **replace function** to convert them into numerical form.
- Visualized feature relationships using **Seaborn**.
- Built an **SVM classifier** for predicting loan approval.

ðŸ“Œ **Goal:** Predict whether a personâ€™s loan **will be approved or not** based on provided attributes.

---
## **Technologies Used:**
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorizer

ðŸ“Œ **This repository showcases my understanding of feature engineering, data preprocessing, visualization, and model implementation in different domains.** ðŸš€
